# fastrot-spec
Computes the surface parameters -radius, temperature, and effective gravity as a function of the latitude- of rapidly rotating stars with radiative envelopes, and builds their synthetic spectra. The parameterisation of the stellar surface is done using the semianalytical approach of the ESTER model presented by Espinosa-Lara and Rieutord (2011); that approach avoid any discussion about the gravity darkening exponent, although the Von Zeipel approximation, beta=0.25, is also included for comparison. The computation of the synthetic spectra are done using the atlas9 and synthe suite of codes by Kurucz (2014).

## Installation & Requirements
 
This repository is under construction. The codes and all the files required to carry out all the computatios described in the paper will be available shortly. Meanwhile, please contact me in case you need further details.
